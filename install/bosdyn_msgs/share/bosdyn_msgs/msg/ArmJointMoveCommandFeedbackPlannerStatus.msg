int8 PLANNER_STATUS_UNKNOWN=0
# A solution passing through the desired points and obeying the constraints was found.
int8 PLANNER_STATUS_SUCCESS=1
# The planner had to modify the desired points in order to obey the constraints.  For
# example, if you specify a 1 point trajectory, and tell it to get there in a really short
# amount of time, but haven't set a high allowable max velocity / acceleration, the planner
# will do its best to get as close as possible to the final point, but won't reach it. In
# situations where we've modified you last point, we append a minimum time trajectory (that
# obeys the velocity and acceleration limits) from the planner's final point to the requested
# final point.
int8 PLANNER_STATUS_MODIFIED=2
# Failed to compute a valid trajectory, will go to first point instead. It is possible
# that our optimizer till fail to solve the problem instead of returning a sub-optimal
# solution.  This is un-likely to occur.
