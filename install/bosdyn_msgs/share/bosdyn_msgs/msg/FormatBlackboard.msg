# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# Sets a blackboard variable to a formatted string, reading from other blackboard vars.

# The key of the variable that will be written.
string key

# Define a format string that will be used together with the blackboard to generate
# string value.  Values from the blackboard will replace the keys in braces {}, i.e.
# {blackboard_variable_name}.  We also allow some string formatting options, namely:
#
# 1) Floating point decimal places: {float_variable:.2f}
# 2) TBD
#
# Select examples:
#
# Format String: "telop-{date}"
#    Blackboard: "date" is a blackboard variable with string value: "2021-05-13"
#        Output: "teleop-2021-05-13"
#
# Format String: "{date}_loop_{loop_counter}"
#    Blackboard: "date" is a blackboard variable with string value: "2021-05-13"
#    Blackboard: "loop_counter" is a blackboard variable with integer value: "3"
#        Output: "2021-05-13_loop_3"
#
# Format String: "battery charge is: {state.power_state.locomotion_charge_percentage.value}"
#    Blackboard: "state" is a protobuf message in the blackboard from a BosdynRobotState, and
#                the power_state submessage has a charge percentage of 30.2148320923085
#        Output: "battery charge is: 30.2158320923085"
#
# Format String: "battery charge is:
# {state.power_state.locomotion_charge_percentage.value:.2f}"
#    Blackboard: "state" is a protobuf message in the blackboard from a BosdynRobotState, and
#                the power_state submessage has a charge percentage of 30.2148320923085
#        Output: "battery charge is: 30.21"
#
# Format String: "the value is {x:.0f}"
#    Blackboard: "x" is a blackboard variable with float value: "2.71828"
#        Output: "the value is 3"
