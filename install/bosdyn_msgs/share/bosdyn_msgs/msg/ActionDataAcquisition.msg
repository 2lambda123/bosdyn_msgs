# Any images taken at action creation time.  For DataAcquisition actions, this includes:
#    - Any images in the Data Acquisition capture.
#    - Any images that are inputs to NCB workers that are in the Data Acquisition capture.
#    - Any images that a Data Acquisition plugin in the Data Acquisition capture requests a
#    region of interest for.
#
# Note that both this message and AcquisitionCapabilityList will contain the
# Spec for images sources.  This message will contain the spec at record time,
# while last_known_capabilities should be updated as time progresses and services
# evolve.
#
# This data is meant to allow UI's to give users context about their actions, AND
# provide them a canvas to edit region of interests with after the fact.  It is
# not used at mission playback time.
