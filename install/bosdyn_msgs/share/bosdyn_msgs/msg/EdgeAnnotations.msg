# If true, the edge crosses flat ground and the robot shouldn't try to climb over
# obstacles.
# DEPRECATED as of 3.3.  Replaced by ground_clutter_mode.

# necessary on the robot side. Best suggested values lie in the range between 0.4 and 0.8
# (which is the robot's default.)
# DEPRECATED as of 2.1 and will be removed in 4.0. Use mobility_params instead, which
# includes ground_mu_hint as part of the terrain_params.

# If true, the edge crosses over grated metal. This changes some parameters of the robot's
# perception system to allow it to see grated floors bettter.

# "terrain_params.enable_grated_floor", then the map will be
# annotated with "stairs_mode" and "enable_grated_floor" settings. An empty FieldMask means
# all fields are active annotations. Note that the more conservative of the velocity limit
