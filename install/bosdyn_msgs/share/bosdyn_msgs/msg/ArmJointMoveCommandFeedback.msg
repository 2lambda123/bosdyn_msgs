# Based on the user trajectory, the planned knot points that obey acceleration and
# velocity constraints. If these knot points don't match the requested knot points,
# consider increasing velocity/acceleration limits, and/or staying further away from
# joint position limits. In situations where we've modified you last point, we append
# a minimum time trajectory (that obeys the velocity and acceleration limits) from the
# planner's final point to the requested final point. This means that the length of
# planned_points may be one point larger than the requested.
bosdyn_msgs/ArmJointTrajectoryPoint[] planned_points

# Returns amount of time remaining until the joints are at the goal position.  For
# multiple point trajectories, this is the time remaining to the final point.
