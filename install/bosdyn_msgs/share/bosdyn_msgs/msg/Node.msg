# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# Wrapper for a mission node. Contains the basics common to all mission nodes.
# Specifics of what the node does are contained in the "impl" field.

# Human-readable name of this node, e.g. "Goto waypoint 1", or "Power On".
string name
# Collection of user data associated with this node.
bosdyn_msgs/UserData user_data
bool user_data_is_set
# Reference identifier of this node.
# Set iff another node references this one.
string reference_id

bosdyn_msgs/NodeOneOfType type

# Defines parameters, used by this node or its children.
# The "key" in KeyValue is the name of the parameter being defined.
# The value can be a constant or another parameter value.
bosdyn_msgs/KeyValue[] parameter_values

# Overwrites a protobuf field in this node's implementation.
# The "key" in KeyValue is the name of the field to override.
# The value to write can be sourced from a constant, or a parameter value.
bosdyn_msgs/KeyValue[] overrides

# Declares parameters needed at compile time by this node, or children of this node.
# This is a way for a node to communicate what parameters its implementation and/or children
# require, without unpacking the entire subtree.
bosdyn_msgs/VariableDeclaration[] parameters
