# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# Information necessary to uniquely specify a service fault.
# A service fault typically is associated with a service running on the robot or a
# payload. Occassionally, the fault may pertain to a payload but no specific service
# on the payload. In that situation, no service_name should not be specified and instead
# a payload_guid should be specified. Otherwise, in the standard case of a service
# originating fault, only the service_name should be specified and the payload_guid
# will be populated automatically by the fault service on robot.

# Name of the fault.
string fault_name

# Name of the registered service associated with the fault.
# Optional. Service name does not need to be specified if this is a payload-level
# fault with no associated service.
string service_name

# GUID of the payload associated with the faulted service.
# Optional. If not set, it will be assigned to the payload associated with the
# service_name.
string payload_guid
