# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# Represents an interval in x, y, z and yaw around some center. Some value x
# will be within the bounds if  center - x_bounds <= x >= center + x_bounds.
# If the values are left at zero, the bounds are considered to be unconstrained.
# The center of the bounds is left implicit, and should be whatever this message
# is packaged with.

# Bounds on the x position in meters.
float64 x_bounds
# Bounds on the y position in meters.
float64 y_bounds
# Bounds on the z position in meters.
float64 z_bounds
# Bounds on the yaw (rotation around z axis) in radians.
