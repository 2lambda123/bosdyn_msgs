# This field is required.
# This should be a newer lease than the last one used to control the robot.
# For example, if you have acquired lease [6] from the robot, you should begin controlling
# the robot with [6, 0, 1] and pass [6, 1] here.
# If you have added an associated lease, it should be the [6] lease.
