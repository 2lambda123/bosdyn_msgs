# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# Processes a GraphNav map by creating additional edges. After processing,
# a new subgraph is created containing additional edges to add to the map.
# Edges are created between waypoints that are near each other. These waypoint pairs
# are called "loop closures", and are found by different means.
# In general, if parameters are not provided, reasonable defaults will be used.
# Note that this can be used to merge disconnected subgraphs from multiple recording
# sessions so long as they share fiducial observations.

# Parameters for how to refine loop closure edges using iterative
# closest point matching.
# Parameters for how to close loops using odometry. This infers which waypoints
# should be connected to one another based on the odometry measurements in the map.
# Parameters for how to close a loop using fiducials (AprilTags). This infers
# which waypoints should be connected to one another based on shared observations
# of AprilTags.
# Note that multiple disconnected subgraphs (for example from multiple recording sessions)
# can be merged this way.
# Parameters for how to check for collisions when creating loop closures. The system
# will avoid creating edges in the map that the robot cannot actually traverse due to
# the presence of nearby obstacles.
# Parameters which control topology processing. In general, anything which isn't filled out
# will be replaced by reasonable defaults.

# If true, any processing should directly modify the map on the server.
# Otherwise, the client is expected to upload the processing results (newly created edges)
# back to the server. The processing service shares memory with a map container service
# (e.g the GraphNav service).
