# Optional maximum delay between challenge and response for this endpoint prior to disabling
# motor power. After cut_power_timeout seconds has passed, motor power will be disconnected
# immediately regardless of current robot state. If this value is not set robot will default
# to timeout plus a nominal expected duration to reach a safe state. In practice this
# is typically 3-4 seconds. The response is equivalent to an ESTOP_LEVEL_CUT.
