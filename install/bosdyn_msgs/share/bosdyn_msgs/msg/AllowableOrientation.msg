# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# Allowable orientation allow you to specify vectors that the different axes of the robot's
# gripper will be aligned with in the final grasp pose. 
#
# Frame: 
#  In stow position, +X is to the front of the gripper, pointing forward. 
#                    +Y is out of the side of the gripper going to the robot's left 
#                    +Z is straight up towards the sky 
#
# Here, you can supply vectors that you want the gripper to be aligned with at the final grasp
# position.  For example, if you wanted to grasp a cup, you'd wouldn't want a top-down grasp.
# So you might specify: 
#      frame_name = "vision" (so that Z is gravity aligned) 
#       VectorAlignmentWithTolerance: 
#          axis_to_on_gripper_ewrt_gripper = Vec3(0, 0, 1)  <--- we want to control the
#                                                                gripper's z-axis. 
#
#          axis_to_align_with_ewrt_frame = Vec3(0, 0, 1)  <--- ...and we want that axis to be
#                                                                 straight up 
#          tolerance_z = 0.52  <--- 30 degrees 
#    This will ensure that the z-axis of the gripper is pointed within 30 degrees of vertical
#    so that your grasp won't be top-down (which would need the z-axis of the gripper to be
#    pointed at the horizon). 
#
# You can also specify more than one AllowableOrientation to give the system multiple options.
# For example, you could specify that you're OK with either a z-up or z-down version of the cup
# grasp, allowing the gripper roll 180 from the stow position to grasp the cup.
