# Proto for a description of an image source on the robot.


# The camera can be modeled as a pinhole camera described with a matrix.
# Camera Matrix can be constructed by the camera intrinsics:
# [[focal_length.x,         skew.x, principal_point.x],
# [[        skew.y, focal_length.y, principal_point.y],
# [[             0,              0,                 1]]

# The name of this image source used to get images.
string name

# Number of columns in the image (in pixels).
int32 cols
# Number of rows in the image (in pixels).
int32 rows

# For depth images, the pixel value that represents a depth of one meter.
# Depth in meters can be computed by dividing the raw pixel value by this scale factor.
