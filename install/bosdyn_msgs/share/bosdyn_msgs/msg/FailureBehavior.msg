# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# The mission can automatically retry navigating to a waypoint or
# performing an action. Automatic retries can increase the probability of
# successfully navigating to a waypoint, but may cause the robot to take
# an unexpected path. Similarly, they can increase the probability of
# successfully collecting data for an action, but also increase the amount
# of time a mission takes. If the client does not want the robot to
# automatically retry navigating to a waypoint or performing an action,
# set this to 0. If the client wants the robot to automatically retry
# navigating to a waypoint or performing an action, set this to the
# desired number of retries. For example, if the client would like the
# action to be retried once, set this equal to 1. If this is unset or set
# to 0, no retry will occur.

# At mission playback, if something fails (e.g., the robot gets stuck,
# an action fails), the user will get all possible actions as options
# in a question to choose from. If the user does not answer, the mission
# will fall back to the default behavior after this timeout. The default
# behaviors are defined by the default_behavior one_of. A minimum
# duration of 10 seconds is enforced.

# If a failure occurs and the prompt has not been answered, the robot
# will sit down and power off. This is the safest option.

# If a failure occurs and the prompt has not been answered, the robot
# will proceed to the next action if able to do so. This may lead to
# different behavior at mission playback than at mission recording
# (e.g., the robot may take a different route, the robot may fail to
# collect the data for an action).

# Only available in missions with a dock!
# If a failure occurs and the prompt has not been answered, the robot
# will return to the start of the mission. Once at the start of the
# mission, the robot will attempt to dock.  If successfully, robot will
# try again later after the specified delay.

# Only available in missions with a dock!
# If robot can get back to the dock, it will, and if it does, the mission will end.

# Sometimes, the robot may not be able to get to an action (for example,
# its path may be blocked). Similarly, while at a waypoint where an action
# is performed, that action may fail (for example, the sensor is not
# powered on). In case of such failures, the user should choose the desired
# behavior using this enum.
