# Parameters affecting the underlying optimizer.
# Parameters which affect the measurements the optimzier uses to process the anchoring.
# Relative weights to use for each of the optimizer's terms. These can be any positive value.
# If set to zero, a reasonable default will be used. In general, the higher the weight, the more
# the optimizer will care about that particular measurement.

# If true, the anchoring which already exists on the server will be used as the initial
# guess for the optimizer. Otherwise, a new anchoring will be generated for every waypoint
# which doesn't have a value passed in through initial_hint. If no hint is provided,
# and this value is false, every waypoint will be given a starting anchoring based on
# the oldest waypoint in the map.

# The optimizer will try to keep the orientation of waypoints consistent with gravity.
# If provided, this is the gravity direction expressed with respect to the seed. This
# will be interpreted as a unit vector. If not filled out, a default of (0, 0, -1) will be
# used.
