# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# Sets existing blackboard variables within this scope to specific values, returning SUCCESS.

# The key of the KeyValue is the name of the blackboard variable.
# The value will be dereferenced and converted into a value type at runtime
# inside this node's tick function. For example, if the value is a runtime
# variable, that variable will be evaluated at tick time, and then stored into
# the blackboard. If the value is another blackboard variable, that blackboard
# variable's value will be copied into the variable specified by the key.
