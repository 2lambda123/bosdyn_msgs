# Scalar trajectory for opening/closing the gripper. If 1 point is specified
# with no end time, we will execute a minimum time trajectory that observes
# velocity and acceleration constraints. Otherwise, we will use piecewise
# cubic interpolation, meaning there will be a cubic polynomial between each
# trajectory point, with continuous position and velocity at each trajectory
# point. If the requested trajectory violates the velocity or acceleration
# constraints below, a trajectory that is as close as possible but still
# obeys the constraints will be executed instead.
# position is radians: 0 is fully closed -1.5708 (-90 degrees) is fully open
# velocity is radians / sec.

# If specified, the gripper will not exceed these velocity and acceleration
# magnitudes. Note that if a minimum time trajectory is requested, we will
# accelerate and decelerate at maximum_open_close_acceleration, and coast at
# maximum_open_close_velocity.

# If unspecified, a default value of 10 (rad/s) will be used.

# If unspecified, a default value of 40 (rad/s/s) will be used.

# Maximum torque applied. If unspecified, a default value of 5.5 (Nm) will be used.

# By default the gripper transitions to force control when it detects an object closing.
# Setting this field to true disables the transition to force control on contact detection
# and always keeps the gripper in position control.
