# Represents the translation/rotation covariance of an SE3 Pose.
# The 6x6 matrix can be viewed as the covariance among 6 variables: 
#      rx     ry  rz    x    y    z                                 
# rx rxrx  rxry rxrz  rxx  rxy  rxz                                 
# ry ryrx  ryry ryrz  ryx  ryy  ryz                                 
# rz rzrx  rzry rzrz  rzx  rzy  rzz

# z   zrx   zry  zrz   zx   zy   zz                                 
# where x, y, z are translations in meters, and rx, ry, rz are rotations around
# the x, y and z axes in radians.                                   
# The matrix is symmetric, so, for example, xy = yx.
