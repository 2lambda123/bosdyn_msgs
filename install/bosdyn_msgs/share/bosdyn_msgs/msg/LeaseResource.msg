# The robot time when this lease will become stale.  A stale lease can be
# acquired with an AcquireLeaseRequest OR a TakeLeaseRequest, while a lease
# that is not stale can only be acquired with a TakeLeaseRequest.
#
# Leases get marked stale when they haven't been used in a while.  If you want
# to prevent your lease from being marked stale, you need to either:
#     - Periodically send RetainLeaseRequests.
#     - Periodically send valid commands to the robot using the lease.  Note
#       that only some types of commands will actually cause explicit lease
#       retention.
#
# Commands & RetainLeaseRequests issued with a stale lease will still be accepted.
# Stale leases, when used, will cause the used lease to no longer be stale.
#
# DEPRECATED as of 3.3. Lease staleness is now set by the Keepalive service.
# This value is only an estimate, and may not be correct if a Keepalive client has changed it.
# Please use the is_stale flag for an instantaneous report on staleness, or check the
# GetStatusResponse in the Keepalive service to get a time.

# This lease has been marked stale, and may be acquired by another client.
