# Timeout of any single RPC. If the timeout is exceeded, the RPC will fail. The mission service
# treats each failed RPC differently:
# - EstablishSession: An error is returned in LoadMission.
# - Tick: The RPC is retried.
# - Stop: The error is ignored, and the RPC is not retried.

# Define a format string that will be used together with the blackboard to generate
# a group_name.  If a value is specified in this field, it will override the group_name value
# specified in the group_name of the TickRequest.  Values from the blackboard will
# replace the keys in braces {}.
# Example: "telop-{date}", where "date" is a blackboard variable.
# Example: "{date}_loop_{loop_counter}", where "loop_counter" is a blackboard variable from a
# Repeat node.
