# Specify if the hinge is on the left or right side of the door, when looking at the door,
# relative to the door handle.

# Specify if the door is push or pull, when looking at the door.

# The robot searches along a ray for the door handle and automatically grasp it before
# executing door opening.

# The robot is already grasping the door handle and will continue opening the door based on
# user specified params.

# Open doors that do not require a grasp, just a push. This could be a door with no latching
# mechanism that just requires a push, or a door with a pushbar.
# The robot will automatically push the door open and walk through.
