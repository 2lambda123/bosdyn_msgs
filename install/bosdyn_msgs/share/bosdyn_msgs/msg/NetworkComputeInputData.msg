# DEPRECATED as of 3.3. Use NetworkComputeInputDataBridge instead.

# NetworkComputeInputData is multipurpose.  It's used both at runtime to call a NCB
# worker "run right now with this data" AND it's embedded in missions to say "when
# you run this action, run this NCB worker with an image from this camera".  When
# embedded in missions, we store which camera source and service to take a picture from
# at runtime.  At runtime, the ImageSourceAndService is converted to an actual image
# by the NetworkComputeBridge service.  If you're writing a worker, you can always
# expect to receive an actual image.

# Other data that isn't an image.  NetworkComputeBridge service will pass it through

# Options for rotating the image before processing. When unset, no rotation is applied.
# Rotation is supported for data from image services that provide a FrameTreeSnapshot
# defining the sensor's frame with respect to Spot's body and vision frames.
# Field is ignored for non-image input.
# DEPRECATED as of 3.3. Please rotate the image client-side before passing it to NCB worker.
