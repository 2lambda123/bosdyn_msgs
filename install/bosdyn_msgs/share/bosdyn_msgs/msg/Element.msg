# An Element is the basic building block of the autowalk.

# The name of an element may be anything, but it is good practice to choose
# something that describes the physical location and action that is occurring
# (e.g., boiler room laser scan).
string name

# Location the robot should navigate to.
bosdyn_msgs/Target target
bool target_is_set

# Describes what to do if the robot fails to navigate to target.
bosdyn_msgs/FailureBehavior target_failure_behavior
bool target_failure_behavior_is_set

# Action performed at target destination
bosdyn_msgs/Action action
bool action_is_set

# Actions performed by the robot and/or payloads prior to and during an action.
bosdyn_msgs/ActionWrapper action_wrapper
bool action_wrapper_is_set

# Describes what to do if the robot fails to execute the action.
bosdyn_msgs/FailureBehavior action_failure_behavior
bool action_failure_behavior_is_set

# Set to true to skip element.

# If the mission requires more than one battery, the robot needs to return
# to the dock and charge before it can complete the mission.
# This field defines the battery percentage thresholds that at which the robot
# should pause and resume mission execution.
# Considering using various thresholds depending on the target's distance from the dock
bosdyn_msgs/BatteryMonitor battery_monitor
bool battery_monitor_is_set

# Maximum duration of action execution time, including all wrappers.
# If they take longer than this duration, the action will be considered a failure.
# Not including, or including a zero duration will set the action to NOT have a
# timeout.

# Unique identifier for this element.  This will be embedded in various Data Acquisition
# captures and various logging bundles.  This should be globally unique across all elements.
