# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# If your mission has docks, autowalk can pause the mission to return
# to the dock if the battery gets too low.  Use this message to control
# when this behavior happens.

# Once charging, the robot will continue to charge until the battery
# level is greater than or equal to this threshold, at which point in
# time, the mission will start.
float32 battery_start_threshold

# If the battery level is less than or equal to this threshold, the
# robot will stop what it is currently doing and return to the dock.
# Once the battery level is greater than or equal to the battery start
# threshold, the mission will resume.
