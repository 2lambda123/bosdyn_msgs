# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# Get robot into a position where it is safe to power down, then power down. If the robot has
# fallen, it will power down directly. If the robot is standing, it will first sit then power down.
# With appropriate request parameters and under limited scenarios, the robot may take additional
# steps to move to a safe position. The robot will not power down until it is in a sitting state.
