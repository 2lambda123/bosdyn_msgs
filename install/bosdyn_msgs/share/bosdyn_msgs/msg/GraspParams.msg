# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# Where the grasp is on the hand.  Set to 0 to be a (default) palm grasp, where the object will
# be pressed against the gripper's palm plate.  Set to 1.0 to be a fingertip grasp, where the
# robot will try to pick up the target with just the tip of its fingers. 
# Intermediate values move the grasp location between the two extremes.

# Frame name for the frame that the constraints in allowable_orientation are expressed in.

# Optional constraints about the orientation of the grasp.  This field lets you specify things
# like "only do a top down grasp," "grasp only from this direction," or "grasp with the gripper
# upside-down."  If you don't pass anything, the robot will automatically search for a good
# grasp orientation.
bosdyn_msgs/AllowableOrientation[] allowable_orientation

# Optional parameter on how much the robot is allowed to move the grasp from where the user
# requested.  Set this to be GRASP_POSITION_CONSTRAINT_FIXED_AT_USER_POSITION to get a grasp
# that is at the exact position you requested, but has less or no automatic grasp selection
# help in position.
bosdyn_msgs/GraspPositionConstraint position_constraint

# Optional hint about which camera was used to generate the target points.  The robot will
# attempt to correct for calibration error between the arm and the body cameras.
