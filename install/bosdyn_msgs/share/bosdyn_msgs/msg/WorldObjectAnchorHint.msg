# World objects (such as fiducials) may be anchored to a particular seed frame. The user may request that an object
# be anchored in a particular place with some Gaussian uncertainty.
# Note on gravity alignment: optimization is sensitive to bad alignment with respect to gravity. By default, the
# orientation of the seed frame assumes gravity is pointing in the negative z direction. Take care to ensure that
# the orientation of the world object is correct with respect to gravity. By convention, fiducials' orientation
# is defined as: Z out of the page, X up and Y left (when looking at the fiducial). So, if a fiducial is mounted
# perfectly flat against a wall, its orientation w.r.t the seed frame would have the top of the fiducial facing
# positive Z.

# This is the uncertainty of the anchor's pose in the seed frame.
# If left empty, a reasonable default uncertainty will be generated.

bool seed_tform_object_uncertainty_is_set
# Normally, the optimizer will move the anchorings of object based on context, to minimize the
# overall cost of the optimization problem. By providing a constraint on pose, the user can ensure
# that the anchors stay within a certain region in the seed frame.
# Leaving this empty will allow the optimizer to move the anchoring from the hint as far as it likes.
