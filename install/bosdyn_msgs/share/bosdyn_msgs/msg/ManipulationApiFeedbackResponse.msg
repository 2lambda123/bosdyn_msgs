# Data from the manipulation system: 
# "walkto_raycast_intersection": 
#      If you sent a WalkToObject request, we raycast in the world to intersect your pixel/ray
#      with the world.  The point of intersection is included in this transform snapshot
#      with the name "walkto_raycast_intersection". 
# "grasp_planning_solution": 
#      If you requested a grasp plan, this frame will contain the planning solution if
#      available.  This will be the pose of the "hand" frame at the completion of the grasp. 
# "gripper_nearest_object": 
#      If the range camera in the hand senses an object, this frame will have the position of
#      the nearest object.  This is useful for getting a ballpark range measurement.
