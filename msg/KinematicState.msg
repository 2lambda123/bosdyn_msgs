# The kinematic state of the robot describes the current estimated positions of the robot body and joints throughout the world.
# It includes a transform snapshot of the robotâ€™s current known frames as well as joint states and the velocity of the body.

# Joint state of all robot joints.

# Robot clock timestamp corresponding to these readings.

# A tree-based collection of transformations, which will include the transformations to the
# robot body ("body") in addition to transformations to the common frames ("world", "dr") and
# ground plane estimate "gpe".
# All transforms within the snapshot are at the acquisition time of kinematic state.

# Velocity of the body frame with respect to vision frame and expressed in vision frame.
# The linear velocity is applied at the origin of the body frame.
