# Command the end effector of the arm.  Each axis in the task frame is allowed to be set to
# position mode (default) or Force mode.  If the axis is set to position, the desired value is read
# from the pose_trajectory_in_task. If the axis is set to force, the desired value is read from
# the wrench_trajectory. This supports hybrid control of the arm where users can specify, for
# example, Z to be in force control with X and Y in position control.
