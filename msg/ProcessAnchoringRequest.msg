# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# Causes the server to optimize an existing anchoring, or generate a new anchoring for the map using the given parameters.
# In general, if parameters are not provided, reasonable defaults will be used.
# The new anchoring will be streamed back to the client, or modified on the server if desired.

# Parameters for procesing an anchoring.
# Standard request header.

bosdyn_msgs/AnchoringHint initial_hint
bool initial_hint_is_set
# If true, the map currently uploaded to the server will have its anchoring modified.
# Otherwise, the user is expected to re-upload the anchoring.
bool modify_anchoring_on_server
# If true, the anchoring will be streamed back to the user after every iteration.
# This is useful for debug visualization.
