# These parameters are specific to how the robot follows a specified route in NavigateRoute.

# For each enum in this message, if UNKNOWN is passed in, we default to one of the values
# (indicated in the comments). Passing UNKNOWN is not considered a programming error.

# This setting applies when a new NavigateRoute command is issued (different route or
# final-waypoint-offset), and command_id indicates a new command.

# This setting applies when a NavigateRoute command is issued with the same route and
# final-waypoint-offset. It is not necessary that command_id indicate the same command.
# The expected waypoint is the last waypoint that GraphNav was autonomously navigating to.

# This setting applies when the robot discovers that the route is blocked.
