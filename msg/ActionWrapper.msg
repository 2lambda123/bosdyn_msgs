# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# An ActionWrapper is what the robot should do prior to and during an action.
# For example, the user may desire that the robot stand in such a way that its
# z-axis is aligned with the gravity vector, even though it is standing on an
# incline.

# Sit the robot prior to performing the action

# Pose the robot prior to performing the action

# Set the brightness of the LEDs on the SpotCam.

# Set the pan, tilt, and zoom of the SpotCam.

# Align SpotCam to a waypoint. Cannot be used with SpotCamPtz or RobotBodyPose

# Position the body and perform a joint move and cartesian command in target frame

# Set the camera params of the gripper camera
