# Public spot.InverseKinematics API messages.
# Request a solution to an inverse kinematics problem for Spot (or an indication that a solution
# could not be found). This message can be used to make both reachability and stance-selection
# queries. When filling out the request, the caller specifies one option from each of the following
# categories:
#  - stance specifications (fixed foot positions or feet on a ground plane),
#  - tool specifications (wrist-mounted), and
#  - task specifications (tool pose or gaze)
# When evaluating potential robot configurations, the service considers joint limits, and static
# stability in addition to the requirements specified in the request.

# The root frame is the parent for the optional scene frame. The root frame must be
# either “vision" or “odom”.
string root_frame_name

# The task frame as well as body and foot related fields below are specified in this optional
# scene frame. If unset, it defaults to the identity transform and all scene quantities are
# therefore expressed in the root frame. This frame is useful in cases where the inverse
# kinematics problem is most easily defined relative to some other frame (e.g. the frame
# defined by a fiducial detection next to a piece of equipment).
geometry_msgs/Pose root_tform_scene
bool root_tform_scene_is_set

# Tool related fields below are specified in this optional task frame.  If unset it defaults
# to the identity transform and all task frame quantities are therefore expressed in the scene
# frame.

# The solver will prefer arm configurations close to the specified named configuration.
# Defaults to ARM_CONFIG_CURRENT.
bosdyn_msgs/InverseKinematicsRequestNamedArmConfiguration nominal_arm_configuration

# Entries override the nominal joint positions for the specified arm joints. Unspecified joints
# will use the values specified by nominal_arm_configuration.
bosdyn_msgs/ArmJointPosition nominal_arm_configuration_overrides
bool nominal_arm_configuration_overrides_is_set

# The solver will prefer configurations that put the body close to this pose. Default to the
# current body pose.
