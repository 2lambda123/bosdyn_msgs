int8 PARAM_NOT_SET=0
# Desired base offset relative to the footprint pseudo-frame.
# The footprint pseudo-frame is a gravity aligned frame with its origin located at the
# geometric center of the feet in the X-Y axis, and at the nominal height of the hips in
# the Z axis. The yaw of the frame (wrt the world) is calcuated by the average foot
# locations, and is aligned with the feet.
int8 PARAM_BASE_OFFSET_RT_FOOTPRINT_SET=7
bosdyn_msgs/SE3Trajectory base_offset_rt_footprint

# The base will adjust to assist with manipulation, adjusting its height, pitch, and yaw as
# a function of the hand's location.  Note, manipulation assisted body control is only
# available for ArmCommand requests that control the end-effector, and are expressed in an
# inertial frame.  For example, sending a ArmCartesianCommand request with root_frame_name
# set to "odom" will allow the robot to compute a body adjustment.  However, sending a
# ArmCartesianCommand request with root_frame_name set to "body" or sending an
# ArmJointMoveCommand request is incompatible, and the body will reset to default height
# and orientation.
int8 PARAM_BODY_ASSIST_FOR_MANIPULATION_SET=17
bosdyn_msgs/BodyControlParamsBodyAssistForManipulation body_assist_for_manipulation

# An absolute desired position and orientation of the robot body origin. Command may be
# saturated to achievable or safe postures on receipt. Note: This parameter only has effect
# when coupled with a StandCommand. For other commands, the robot will fall back to
# defaults.
int8 PARAM_BODY_POSE_SET=23
bosdyn_msgs/BodyControlParamsBodyPose body_pose

# Only one of the above can be filled in.  Use the enum to choose which.
