#/ The linear velocities for the end-effector are specified in unitless cylindrical
#/ coordinates. The origin of the cylindrical coordinate system is the base of the arm
#/ (shoulder).  The Z-axis is aligned with gravity, and the X-axis is the unit vector from
#/ the shoulder to the hand-point. This construction allows for 'Z'-axis velocities to
#/ raise/lower the hand, 'R'-axis velocities will cause the hand to move towards/away from
#/ the shoulder, and 'theta'-axis velocities will cause the hand to travel
#/ clockwise/counter-clockwise around the shoulder. Lastly, the command is unitless, with
#/ values for each axis specified in the range [-1, 1].  A value of 0 denotes no velocity
#/ and values of +/- 1 denote maximum velocity (see max_linear_velocity).

#/ The maximum velocity in meters / second for the hand.
#/ If unset and default value of 0 received, will set max_linear_velocity to 0.5 m/s.
