# If this is set to true, mission compilation will fail if the Walk contains parameters that
# are set incorrectly. This can be useful during development to help the developer find issues
# with their client (e.g., suppose the client UI allows a user to set a parameter incorrectly).
# If this is set to false, mission compilation is more likely to succeed for the same Walk
# because any parameters that are both incorrect and modifiable are modified during mission
# compilation.
