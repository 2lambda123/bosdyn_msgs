# The robot will find the shortest path to the start of the route, possibly using
# edges that are not in the route. After going to the start, the robot will follow the
# route.
int8 START_GOTO_START=1
# The robot will find the shortest path to any point on the route, and go to the point
# that gives that shortest path. Then, the robot will follow the rest of the route from
# that point.
# If multiple points on the route are similarly close to the robot, the robot will
# prefer the earliest on the route.
# This is the default.
int8 START_GOTO_ROUTE=2
# The robot will fail the command with status STATUS_NOT_LOCALIZED_TO_ROUTE.
