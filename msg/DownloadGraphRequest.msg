# The DownloadGraphRequest requests that the server send the graph (waypoints and edges)
# to the client. Note that the returned Graph message contains only the topological
# structure of the map, and not any large sensor data. Large sensor data should be downloaded
# using DownloadWaypointSnapshotRequest and DownloadEdgeSnapshotRequest. Both snapshots and
# the graph are required to exist on the server for GraphNav to localize and navigate.
