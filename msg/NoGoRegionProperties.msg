bosdyn_msgs/NoGoRegionPropertiesOneOfRegion region

# Nominally, setting a NoGoRegion will create both a body obstacle of the specified size, as
# well as foot obstacle with a slightly inflated size by about the width of the robot's foot,
# to prevent the robot from stepping right on the edge of the body obstacle.  If this is not
# the desired behavior, change the parameters below:

# If set true, will NOT create a foot obstacle for this region.
bool disable_foot_obstacle_generation
# If set true, will NOT create a body obstacle for this region.
bool disable_body_obstacle_generation
# If set true, and a foot obstacle is being generated, will make the foot obstacle the exact
# size specified in the "region" field and NOT inflate by approx. robot foot width.
