# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# The current system faults for a robot.
# A fault is an indicator of a hardware or software problem on the robot. An
# active fault may indicate the robot may fail to comply with a user request.
# The exact response a fault may vary, but possible responses include: failure
# to enable motor power, loss of perception enabled behavior, or triggering a
# fault recovery behavior on robot.

# Name of the fault.
string name

# Time of robot local clock at fault onset.

# Time elapsed since onset of the fault.

# Error code returned by a fault. The exact interpretation of the fault code
# is unique to each variety of fault on the robot. The code is useful for
# Boston Dynamics support staff to diagnose hardware/software issues on
# robot.

# User visible description of the fault (and possibly remedies.)
string error_message

# Fault attributes
# Each fault may be flagged with attribute metadata (strings in this case.)
# These attributes are useful to communicate that a particular fault may
# have significant effect on robot operations. Some potential attributes
# may be "robot", "imu", "vision", or "battery". These attributes would let
# us flag a fault as indicating a problem with the base robot hardware,
# gyro, perception system, or battery respectively. A fault may have, zero,
# one, or more attributes attached to it, i.e. a "battery" fault may also
# be considered a "robot" fault.
string[] attributes


# Fault severity, how bad is the fault?
# The severity level will have some indication of the potential robot
# response to the fault. For example, a fault marked with "battery"
# attribute and severity level SEVERITY_WARN may indicate a low battery
# state of charge. However a "battery" fault with severity level
# SEVERITY_CRITICAL likely means the robot is going to shutdown
# immediately.
