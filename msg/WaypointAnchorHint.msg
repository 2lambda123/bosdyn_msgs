# Waypoints may be anchored to a particular seed frame. The user may request that a waypoint
# be anchored in a particular place with some Gaussian uncertainty.
# Note on gravity alignment: optimization is sensitive to bad alignment with respect to gravity. By default, the
# orientation of the seed frame assumes gravity is pointing in the negative z direction. Take care to ensure that
# the orientation of the waypoint is correct with respect to gravity. By convention, waypoints' orientation
# is defined as: Z up, X forward, Y left. So, if the robot is flat on the ground, the waypoint's z axis should
# align with the seed frame's z axis.

# Normally, the optimizer will move the anchorings of waypoints based on context, to minimize the
# overall cost of the optimization problem. By providing a constraint on pose, the user can ensure
# that the anchors stay within a certain region in the seed frame.
# Leaving this empty will allow the optimizer to move the anchoring from the hint as far as it likes.
