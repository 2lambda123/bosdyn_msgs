# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# The current state of each system fault the robot is experiencing.
# An "active" fault indicates a hardware/software currently on the robot.
# A "historical" fault indicates a, now cleared, hardware/software problem.
# Historical faults are useful to diagnose robot behavior subject to intermittent failed states.

# Currently active faults
bosdyn_msgs/SystemFault[] faults

# Inactive faults that cleared within the last 10 minutes
bosdyn_msgs/SystemFault[] historical_faults

# Aggregated fault data.
# This provides a very quick way of determining if there any
# "battery" or "vision" faults above a certain severity level.
