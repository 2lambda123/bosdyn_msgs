# Parameters common across arm commands.

#/ Whether or not to disable the body force limiter running on the robot. By default, this is
#/ on, and the chance that the body falls over because the arm makes contact in the world is
#/ low. If this is purposely disabled (by setting disable_body_force_limiter to True), the arm
#/ may be able to accelerate faster, and apply more force to the world and to objects than usual,
#/ but there is also added risk of the robot falling over.
