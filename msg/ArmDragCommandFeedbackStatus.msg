int8 STATUS_UNKNOWN=0
# Robot is dragging.
int8 STATUS_DRAGGING=1
# Robot is not dragging because grasp failed.
# This could be due to a lost grasp during a drag, or because the gripper isn't in a
# good position at the time of request. You'll have to reposition or regrasp and then
# send a new drag request to overcome this type of error. Note: When requesting drag,
# make sure the gripper is positioned in front of the robot (not to the side of or
# above the robot body).
int8 STATUS_GRASP_FAILED=2
# Robot is not dragging for another reason.
# This might be because the gripper isn't holding an item.
# You can continue dragging once you resolve this type of error (i.e. by sending an
# ApiGraspOverride request). Note: When requesting drag, be sure to that the robot
# knows it's holding something (or use APIGraspOverride to OVERRIDE_HOLDING).
