# Ground contact parameters that describe the terrain.

# Terrain coefficient of friction user hint. This value must be postive and will clamped if
# necessary on the robot side. Best suggested values lie in the range between 0.4 and 0.8

# *** Deprecation Warning ***
# DEPRECATED as of 3.0.0: The boolean field has been replaced by the field grated_surfaces_mode
# The following field will be deprecated and moved to 'reserved' in a future release.

# Options for Grated Surfaces Mode. When Grated Surfaces Mode is on, the robot assumes the
# ground below it is made of grated metal or other repeated pattern. When on, the robot will
# make assumptions about the environment structure and more aggressively filter noise in
# perception data.
