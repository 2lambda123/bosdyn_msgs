# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# This allows a user to move the arm's joints directly. Each of the arm's joints will never move
# faster than maximum_velocity and never accelerate faster than maximum_acceleration. The user can
# specify a trajectory of joint positions and optional velocities for the arm to follow. The
# trajectory will be acted upon as follows. If a single trajectory point with no time is provided,
# the arm will take the joint currently furthest away from the goal pose and plan a minimum time
# trajectory such that the joint accelerates at maximum_acceleration, coasts at maximum_velocity,
# and decelerates at maximum_acceleration. The other joints will accelerate at
# maximum_acceleration, but then coast at a slower speed such that all joints arrive at the goal
# pose simultaneously with zero velocity. If the user provides trajectory times, the robot will fit
# a piece-wise cubic trajectory (continuous position and velocity) to the user's requested
# positions and (optional) velocities. If the requested trajectory is not achievable because it
# will violate position limits or the maximum_velocity or maximum_acceleration, the robot will pick
# a trajectory that is as close as possible to the user requested without violating velocity or
# acceleration limits.
#
# If the robot is not hitting the desired trajectory, try increasing the time between knot points,
# increasing the max velocity and acceleration, or only specifying joint position goals without a
# velocity
