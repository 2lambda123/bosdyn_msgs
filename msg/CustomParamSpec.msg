# This boolean controls whether or not the parameter at the specified key needs to be
# included by the client.  Not sending a parameter can be used to signal to the service
# to "pick your own".  Example: a camera with autofocus can specify the focus parameter as
# not required.  If focus isn't specified, the service can run it's auto focus routine at
# runtime.
