# A passphrase is a human-readable string used to generate
# an encryption key. An empty passphrase disables encryption.

# If the encryption key is set, everything new written to the drive gets encrypted. this
# includes

# 1) the sql database
# 2) logged data
# 3) audio files uploaded with the Audio service
# 4) probably other stuff that I haven't thought of

# If it's called repeatedly (with different keys), old data will
# still be on the disk, but unreadable, so new data will be
# written with the new key. the only exception is this; when
# encryption is off and a key is written, the sql database gets
# encrypted with the new key; old log and audio data remains
# unencrypted however.

# After setting the passphrase, please reboot the system to
# remount the encrypted filesystem layer.
