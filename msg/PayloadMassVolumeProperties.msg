# PayloadMassVolumeProperties contain mass and volume information for the payload
# in the format that the user interacts with it. It is transmitted to the control
# and perception systems and processed there to inform those systems.

# Total mass of payload in kg.
float32 total_mass
# Position of the center of mass of the payload in the payload frame. Meters.
geometry_msgs/Vector3 com_pos_rt_payload
bool com_pos_rt_payload_is_set
# The moment of inertia of the payload, represented about the payload
# center of mass, in the payload frame. Units in [kg*m^2].
bosdyn_msgs/MomentOfIntertia moi_tensor
bool moi_tensor_is_set
# Zero or more bounding boxes indicating the occupied volume of the payload.
# These boxes must be represented in the payload frame by specifying
# Must have Box3WithFrame.frame_name == "payload".

# Joint limits defining limits to range of motion of the hips of the robot,
# in order to prevent collisions with the payload.
# This field is optional and is only recommended for advanced development
