# A key or description for selecting a message series.
# Because there may be multiple ways of describing a message series, we identify
#  them by a unique mapping of {key -> value}.
# A series_type corresponds to a set of keys which are expected in the mapping.
# A 'bosdyn:grpc:requests' series_type, containing GRPC robot-id request messages, might
#  thus be specified as:
#   {'service': 'robot_id', 'message': 'bosdyn.api.RobotIdRequest'}
# A 'bosdyn:logtick' series_type, containing a signals data variable from LogTick
#   annotations might be specified as:
#   {'varname': 'tablet.wifi.rssi', 'schema': 'tablet-comms', 'client': 'bd-tablet'}

# This is the kind of spec, which should correspond to a set of keys which are expected
#  in the spec.
string series_type

# This is the "key" for naming the series within the file.
# A key->value description which should be unique for this series within the file
#  with this series_type.
