# the robot's gravity vector does not align with the map's. This can happen if a fiducial
# being used to align to the map was detected wrongly during recording, or if the robot's
# IMU is miscalibrated. It can also occur when the inital guess passed in to the SetLocalization
# RPC is in the incorrect reference frame.
