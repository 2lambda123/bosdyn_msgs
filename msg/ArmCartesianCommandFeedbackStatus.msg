# STATUS_UNKNOWN should never be used. If used, an internal error has happened.
int8 STATUS_UNKNOWN=0
# Tool frame has reached the end of the trajectory within tracking error bounds.
int8 STATUS_TRAJECTORY_COMPLETE=1
# Robot is attempting to reach the target.
int8 STATUS_IN_PROGRESS=2
# Tool frame exceeded maximum allowable tracking error from the desired trajectory.
int8 STATUS_TRAJECTORY_CANCELLED=3
# The arm has stopped making progress to the goal.  Note, this does not cancel the
# trajectory. For example, if the requested goal is too far away, walking the base
# robot closer to the goal will cause the arm to continue along the trajectory once the
# goal point is inside the workspace.
