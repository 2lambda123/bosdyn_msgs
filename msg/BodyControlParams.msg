# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# Parameters for offsetting the body from the normal default.


bosdyn_msgs/BodyControlParamsOneOfParam param

# Setting for how the robot interprets base offset pitch & roll components.
# In the default case (ROTATION_SETTING_OFFSET) the robot will naturally align the body to the pitch of the current terrain.
# In some circumstances, the user may wish to override this value and try to maintain alignment
# with respect to gravity. Be careful with this setting as it may likely degrade robot performance in
# complex terrain, e.g. stairs, platforms, or slopes of sufficiently high grade.
# The rotation setting for the robot body.  Ignored if body_assist_for_manipulation is requested.
bosdyn_msgs/BodyControlParamsRotationSetting rotation_setting

# Instead of directly specify the base offset trajectory, these options allow the robot to calcuate offsets
# based on the hand's location.  If the robot does not have a SpotArm attached, sending this request will
# hvae no effect.
