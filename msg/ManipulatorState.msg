# The stowing behavior is modified as a function of the Carry State.  If holding an item, the
# stowing behavior will be modified as follows:
#  NOT_CARRIABLE - The arm will not stow, instead entering stop
#  CARRIABLE - The arm will not stow, instead entering stop
#  CARRIABLE_AND_STOWABLE - The arm will stow while continuing to grasp the item
# The comms loss behavior of the arm is also modified as follows:
#  NOT_CARRIABLE - The arm will release the item and stow
#  CARRIABLE - The arm will not stow, instead entering stop
#  CARRIABLE_AND_STOWABLE - The arm will stow while continuing to grasp the item
