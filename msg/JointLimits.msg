# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# JointLimits contain hip joint angles where limb to payload collisions occur.

# Label identifying the respective limb to which these apply [fr,fl,hr,hl]
string label
# (hy, hx) coordinates outlining the hip joint limits where collisions occur
# between robot hip and payload. Paired vectors must be of equal length.
# Angles are measured with actual contact. Appropriate margin will be provided
# in software. Radians.
# Left legs must have hx > 0. Right legs must have hx < 0.
float32[] hy
# All legs must have hy > 1.3.
float32[] hx
