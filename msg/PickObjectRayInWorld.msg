# Cast a ray in the world and pick the first object found along the ray. 
# This is the lowest-level grasping message; all other grasp options internally use this
# message to trigger a grasp. 
# Example:
#  You see the object you are interested in with the gripper's camera.  To grasp it, you
#  cast a ray from the camera out to 4 meters (well past the object). 
#  To do this you'd set: 
#      ray_start_rt_frame: camera's position 
#      ray_end_rt_frame: camera's position + unit vector along ray of interest * 4 meters

# Name of the frame the above parameters are represented in.

# Optional parameters for the grasp.

bool grasp_params_is_set

# Configure if the robot should automatically walk and/or gaze at the target object before
# performing the grasp. 
# 1. If you haven't moved the robot or deployed the arm, use PICK_AUTO_WALK_AND_GAZE 
# 2. If you have moved to the location you want to pick from, but haven't yet deployed the arm,
#    use PICK_AUTO_GAZE. 
# 3. If you have already moved the robot and have the hand looking at your target object, use
#    PICK_NO_AUTO_WALK_OR_GAZE. 
# If you are seeing issues with "MANIP_STATE_GRASP_FAILED_TO_RAYCAST_INTO_MAP," that means that
# the automatic system cannot find your object when trying to automatically walk to it, so
# consider using PICK_AUTO_GAZE or PICK_NO_AUTO_WALK_OR_GAZE.
