# The name of the frame that velocity and slew_rate_limit are relative to.
# The trajectory must be expressed in a gravity aligned frame, so either
# "vision", "odom", or "flat_body". Any other provided
# se2_frame_name will be rejected and the velocity command will not be executed.

# Desired planar velocity of the robot body relative to se2_frame_name.

bool velocity_is_set

# If set, limits how quickly velocity can change relative to se2_frame_name.
# Otherwise, robot may decide to limit velocities using default settings.
# These values should be non-negative.
