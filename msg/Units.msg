# If a service wants an absolute temperature threshold between 0 C  and 100 C, that would show
# up as 32 F to 212 F on any Fahrenheit loving clients IF is_relative is set to false.  Note
# the change from 0 C to 32 F.

# If a service wants a relative temperate threshold (region A must be no more than X degrees
# hotter than region B), between 0 and 100 C, that would show up as 0 F to 180 F on any
# Fahrenheit loving clients IF is_relative is set to true.  Note that 0 C now maps to 0 F.
