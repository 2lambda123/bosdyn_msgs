# A DataDescriptor describes a data block which immediately follows it in the file.
# A corresponding SeriesDescriptor with a matching series_index must precede this in the file.

# The series_index references the SeriesDescriptor to which the data following is associated.

# The time at which the data is considered to be captured/sampled.
# E.g., the shutter-close time of a captured image.

# Sometimes a visualizer will want to organize message by data timestamp, sometimes by
#  the time messages were published or logged.
# The additional_indexes field allows extra indexes or timestamps to be associated with
#  each data block for this purpose.
# Other identifying information may also be used here, such as the PID of the process which
#  originated the data (e.g., for detecting if and when that process restarted).
# The values in this field should correspond to the labels defined in "additional_index_names"
#  in the corresponding SeriesDescriptor.
