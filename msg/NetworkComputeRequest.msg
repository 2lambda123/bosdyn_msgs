# Notes: If the client specifies the old deprecated input_data field, the NetworkComputeBridge
# will responds with the older output format.  This is because the NetworkComputeBridge does
# not know if the client can handle the new output format.
#
# 1. NetworkComputeBridge will call the worker's deprecated [NetworkCompute] RPC, and use
#    deprecated output fields.
# 2. NetworkComputeBridge will call the worker's deprecated [NetworkCompute] RPC, and use
#    deprecated output fields.
# 3. Returns an RPC error.  This row represents older clients talking to newer workers.
#    Upgrade the client in this cast.
# 4. NetworkComputeBridge will call the [WorkerCompute] RPC, and use the new output fields.
# 5. NetworkComputeBridge will call the [WorkerCompute] RPC which will return an Unimplemented
#    error.  The NetworkComputeBridge will then silently gobble up that error, call the
#    worker's old deprecated [NetworkCompute] RPC, and convert the output of that RPC to the
#    new format.
# 6. NetworkComputeBridge will call the [WorkerCompute] RPC, and use the new output fields.
