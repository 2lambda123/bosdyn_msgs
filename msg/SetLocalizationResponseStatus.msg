# The status is unknown/unset.
int8 STATUS_UNKNOWN=0
# Localization success.
int8 STATUS_OK=1
# Robot is experiencing a condition that prevents localization.
int8 STATUS_ROBOT_IMPAIRED=2
# The given waypoint is unknown by the system.
# This could be due to a client error, or because the graph was changed out from under the
# client.
int8 STATUS_UNKNOWN_WAYPOINT=3
# Localization was aborted, likely because of a new request.
int8 STATUS_ABORTED=4
# Failed to localize for some other reason; see the error_report for details.
# This is often because the initial guess was incorrect.
int8 STATUS_FAILED=5
# Failed to localize because the fiducial requested by 'use_fiducial_id' was too far away from
# the robot.
int8 STATUS_FIDUCIAL_TOO_FAR_AWAY=6
# Failed to localize because the fiducial requested by 'use_fiducial_id' had a detection time that was too
# far in the past.
int8 STATUS_FIDUCIAL_TOO_OLD=7
# Failed to localize because the fiducial requested by 'use_fiducial_id' did not exist in the map at
# the required location.
int8 STATUS_NO_MATCHING_FIDUCIAL=8
# Failed to localize because the fiducial requested by 'use_fiducial_id' had an unreliable
# pose estimation, either in the current detection of that fiducial, or in detections that
# were saved in the map. Note that when using FIDUCIAL_INIT_SPECIFIC, fiducial detections at
# the target waypoint will be used so long as they are not uncertain -- otherwise, detections
# at adjacent waypoints may be used. If there exists no uncertain detection of the fiducial
# near the target waypoint in the map, the service returns this status.
int8 STATUS_FIDUCIAL_POSE_UNCERTAIN=9
# The localization could not be set, because the map was recorded using a different sensor
# setup than the robot currently has onboard. See SensorStatus for more details.
int8 STATUS_INCOMPATIBLE_SENSORS=10
# Visual feature based alignment failed or the pose solution was considered unreliable.
