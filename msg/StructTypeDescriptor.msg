# A struct series is a composite formed by a set of other series whose messages or signals-ticks
#  are sampled at the same time.
# For example, all there may be a struct series for a set of signals variables, all from a
#  process with an 'update()' function within which all all variables are sampled with the
#  same timestamp.
# DataBlocks will not directly reference this series, but only child series of this series.
# Struct series may reference other struct series, but the series structure must be a directed
#  acyclic graph (DAG): no circular reference structures.

# A map of a name-reference to a series, identified by its series_identifer_hash.
