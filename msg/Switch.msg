# This node exists because of a subtle implmentation detail in Selector(always_restart = true).
# The astute reader might believe that they can construct a switch node by using a selector
# with sequences & conditions as children.  This is ALMOST true, EXCEPT that a selector 
# (with always_restart = true) can leave multiple children in the running state IF:
#
#  - A later selector child was RUNNING last tick
#  - An eariler selector child returns RUNNING this tick
#
# Even though the later selector child won't be ticked, it will still be left in the running state
# and not restart when the selector advances to it again later.  Sometimes this is desireable,
# sometimes it isn't.  Switch is constrained to only have one child running, and if the switch ever
# switches children and return to a previously running child, that child will be restarted.

# Expresses an integer value that decides which child to run.
