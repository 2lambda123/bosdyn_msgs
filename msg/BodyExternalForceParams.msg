# Specifies a force that the body should expect to feel. This allows the robot to "lean into"
# an external force. Be careful using this override, since incorrect information can cause
# the robot to fall over.
# For example, if the robot is leaning against a wall in front of it, the force override would be in the
# negative x dimension. If the robot was pulling something directly behind it, the force override would
# be in the negative x dimension as well.
