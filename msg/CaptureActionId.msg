# The CaptureActionId describes the entire capture action for an AcquireData request and will be
# used to uniquely identify that full request's set of stored data.

# The action name is used to group all pieces of data associated with a single AcquireData
# request. The action name must be unique for the given group name, meaning no two actions
# with the same group name can have the same action name.
string action_name

# The group name is used to group a "session" of data, such as a mission or a teleop capture
# session, which includes multiple capture actions (from multiple AcquireData RPCs).
string group_name

# Time (in the robot's clock) at which this capture was triggered. If the timestamp is not
# specified in the AcquireData RPC, the main data acquisition service on robot will populate
# the timestamp field with the timestamp of when the RPC was recieved.
