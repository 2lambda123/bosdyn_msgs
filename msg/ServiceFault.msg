# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# The current service faults for services registered with the robot.
# A fault is an indicator of a problem with a service or payload registered
# with the robot. An active fault may indicate a service may fail to comply
# with a user request.
# If the name, service_name, and payload_guid of a newly triggered ServiceFault matches an
# already active ServiceFault the new fault will not be added to the active fault list.
# The oldest matching fault will be maintained.

# User visible description of the fault (and possibly remedies). Will be

# Fault attributes
# Each fault may be flagged with attribute metadata (strings in this case.)
# These attributes are useful to communicate that a particular fault may
# have significant effect on the operations of services. Some potential attributes
# may be "autowalk", "Spot CORE", "vision", or "gauge detection". These
# attributes enable the caller to flag a fault as indicating a problem with
# particular robot abstractions. A fault may have, zero, one, or more
# attributes attached to it.
string[] attributes


# The severity level will have some indication of the potential breakage
# resulting from the fault. For example, a fault associated with payload
# X and severity level SEVERITY_INFO may indicate the payload is in an
# unexpected state but still operational. However, a fault with serverity
# level SEVERITY_CRITICAL may indicate the payload is no
# longer operational.
