# The world object message is used to describe different objects seen by a robot. It contains information
# about the properties of the object in addition to a unique id and the transform snapshot.
# The world object uses "properties" to describe different traits about the object, such as image coordinates
# associated with the camera the object was detected in. A world object can have multiple different properties
# that are all associated with the single object.

# Unique integer identifier that will be consistent for the duration of a robot's battery life
# The id is set internally by the world object service.
int32 id

# A human readable name for the world object. Note that this differs from any frame_name's associated
# with the object (since there can be multiple frames describing a single object).
string name

# Time in robot time clock at which this object was most recently detected and valid.

# A tree-based collection of transformations, which will include the transformations to each
# of the returned world objects in addition to transformations to the common frames ("vision",
# "body", "odom"). All transforms within the snapshot are at the acquisition time of the world object.

# the apriltag frame name is defined in the AprilTagProperties message as "frame_name_fiducial"
