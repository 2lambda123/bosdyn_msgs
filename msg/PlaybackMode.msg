# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# The playback mode governs how many times the mission is played back (once or
# more), at what interval the playbacks should occur (e.g., every 2 hours),
# and if docking is involved, the battery level thresholds at which the robot
# should either (1) stop and charge or (2) start the playback process again.

# The mission should be played back once.

# The mission should be played back periodically.

# The mission should be played continuously only stopping if a battery
# monitor stop threshold is crossed.
