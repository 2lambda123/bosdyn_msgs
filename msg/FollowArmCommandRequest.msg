# DEPRECATED as of 3.1.
# To reproduce the robot's behavior of disable_walking == true,
# issue a StandCommand setting the enable_body_yaw_assist_for_manipulation and
# enable_hip_height_assist_for_manipulation MobilityParams to true.  Any combination
# of the enable_*_for_manipulation are accepted in stand giving finer control of
# the robot's behavior.
