# The interval is the time that will elapse between the mission
# finishing and starting again. It is applied relative to the time at
# which the mission finishes. For example, if the user sets the
# interval to 2 hours, starts the mission at 12:00, and the mission
# takes one hour (finishes at 13:00), the next mission would start at
# 15:00, NOT 14:00.
# Next mission start time = current mission end time + interval

# The number of times the mission should be played back. If set to 1,
# the interval no longer applies and the mission will be played back
# once. If set to two or more, the mission will run that number of
# times, with the amount of time between playbacks equal to the
# interval. If set to zero, the mission will run "forever".
