# As a file is closed, a DescriptorBlock containing a FileIndex should be written.
# The FileIndex summarizes the data series stored in the file and the location of the
#  block-indexes for each type in the file.
# Each series is assigned a "series_index" within the file, and this index may be used to
#  index into the repeated fields in this message.
# E.g., for the series with series_index N, you can access its SeriesIdentifier by accessing
#  element N the of the series_identifiers repeated field.

# SeriesIdentifer for each series in this file.
bosdyn_msgs/SeriesIdentifier[] series_identifiers

# The offset from the start of the file of the SeriesBlockIndex block for each series.
uint64[] series_block_index_offsets

# The hash of the series_identifier for each series.
uint64[] series_identifier_hashes
