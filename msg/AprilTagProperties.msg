# A 6 x 6 Covariance matrix representing the marginal uncertainty of the last detection.
# The rows/columns are:
# rx, ry, rz, tx, ty, tz
# which represent incremental rotation and translation along the x, y, and z axes of the
# given frame, respectively.
# This is computed using the Jacobian of the pose estimation algorithm.
