# The file format consists of 3 kinds of blocks with simple framing:
#  - Serialized DescriptorBlock protos, describing either the main file,
#     a defining a series of data blocks, or a file index,
#  - Serialized DataDescriptorBlock protos, describing a single data block, and
#  - Binary data.
# A Descriptor block typically describes a series of messages, but the descriptor at the
#  start of the file describes the contents of the file as a whole, and the descriptor
#  at the end of the file is an index structure to allow efficient access to the contents
#  of the file.
