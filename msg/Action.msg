# AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED BY PROTO CONVERSION

# An Action is what the robot should do at a location. For example, the user
# may desire that the robot perform a laser scan at a given waypoint.

# The robot does nothing but wait while
# also performing its ActionWrapper(s). For example, if the user
# wants the robot to pose for some amount of time (while doing
# nothing else), they would populate an ActionWrapper with Pose
# and set the desired duration here accordingly.

# For actions associated with the Data Acquisition Service.
