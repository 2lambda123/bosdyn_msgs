bool action_id_is_set

# Data buffer channel associated with the DataBlob. The channel is used to group data across
# actions by a specific source, and it can be used in queries to retrieve some subset of data.
# For example, the channel could be "ptz" and queries can be made for all PTZ images.
string channel

# Data-specific identifier that can optionally be used to disambiguate cases where the
# action_id and channel are insufficient. For example, you save cropped SpotCAM pano image that
# are detected as gauges to a "detected_gauges" channel, but want a way to further individually
# identify them as each specific gauge, so you give each detection a unique data_name.
string data_name

# Unique identifier specified by the Data Acquisition Store service for this individual piece
# of data. It is a monotonically-increasing value that is incremented for each stored capture.
# This value is intended to be unique to a robot and not globally unique. We do not guarantee
# uniqueness pre and post software upgrades or factory resets. This id does not necessarily
# start at 0.
