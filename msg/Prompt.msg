# Prompt the world at large to answer a question.
# This node represents a request for information from ANY listeners that may be out there.

# Should we always re-prompt when this node is started?
# If false, this node will only ever prompt if it is started and its question is unanswered.
# This may be used, for example, to ask the user to check the robot after any self-right.
# If true, this node will prompt whenever it is started.
# This may be used, for example, to tell the user to perform some one-time action, like open a
# door for the robot.

# WARN: Something went wrong, but the mission will try to recover autonomously.
# ERROR: Something went wrong, and the mission can't recover without human intervention.
# Intervention is not time sensitive and can be resolved when convenient.
# CRITICAL: Something went wrong, and the mission can't recover without human intervention.
